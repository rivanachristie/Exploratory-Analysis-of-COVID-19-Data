# Exploratory Analysis of COVID-19 Data
As part of this project, we have analyzed trends in confirmed and recovered cases as well as deaths for the countries around the globe based on the COVID-19 dataset provided by Johns Hopkins University using the Data Science libraries in Python.

We have also analyzed the data for confirmed cases to test the hypothesis that warm weather slows down the spread of the virus. However, there was no correlation found between warm weather and decline in the number of confirmed cases.

# About the dataset
In this project, we have used 3 datasets which are as below:
1. COVID-19 Dataset - time-series-19-covid-combined.csv

   This dataset has been provided by Johns Hopkins University and it contains cumulative numbers for confirmed and recovered cases as well as deaths caused by COVID-19 for 195    countries per day since Jan 2020. This dataset is available for use on github as provided by JHU.

2. The world population dataset that is provided as part of the project – worldpopulation.json
   
3. The climate data for 100 cities around the world, which is also provided as part of the project – climate.json
